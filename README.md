### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eduard, and I consider myself an IT enthusiast in my second year of bachelor's degree at the BBU university in Cluj-Napoca. I am currently developing my future programmer skills such as critical thinking or problem solving, while simultaneously studying intermediate to advanced concepts ( OOP, design patterns, parallel programming, POSIX threads, graph theory ). I strongly suggest you to take a look into my in-development GitHub profile :)
